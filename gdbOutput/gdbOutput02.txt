I ran gdb on tests since my test 5 failed. After running gdb I disovered that the bug has to do with the name of the ingredient
since name is not the correct value. caloriesPerGram value is correct.
Looking back on the code after gdb led me in that direction I discovered I am dereferencing 
char pointer name when I am actually not supposed to. I will implement the fix and run my test again.
